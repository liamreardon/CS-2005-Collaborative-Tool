# CS 2005 Collaborative Tool

The prototype of our collaborative tool for students in CS 2005 is a minimum viable product, meaning it has just enough features to satisfy users and provide feedback for future development. 

Our current design and functionality incorporates a basic login and signup with hash protected passwords, the ability for logged in users to create and view threads relating to various class topics, creation of private groups, subscription to threads which may be relevant to a given user, and notifications if a user is subscribed to a thread. Our app design also includes a functioning profile page where users can edit their username, bio, and change their password.

These features work seamlessly and would provide basic functionality for students to collaborate in CS 2005, though it is still just a rough skeleton of what this app could be in production.
